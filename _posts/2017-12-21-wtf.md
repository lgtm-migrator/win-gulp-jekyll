The [NewOrbit] web site was built using Jekyll, amongst other things, but the Jekyll *output* was being pushed to git and published.  This isn't ideal, as normally we want to push (just) source files and have a CI process create the output.

For some sites you can use Jekyll directly with GitHub and [gh-pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/).

Or, as [others](https://rimdev.io/deploying-jekyll-to-windows-azure-app-services/) [have](https://gist.github.com/hashhar/a4cd7a5a21b4922b8a303c7f331a0d2c) [blogged](https://www.michaelcrump.net/azure-tips-and-tricks16/), you can use a [kudu] script to have [Azure] do something similar.

But to build the [NewOrbit] web site we have more than just Jekyll content -- e.g. SASS compilation, site minification -- so we need more than just a `jekyll build`.  We currently use `gulp` to build the site and wanted to use [VSTS] for CI/CD.

This test app is a default Jekyll site (`jekyll new win-gulp-jekyll`) with an added `gulpfile.js` that can do "other stuff" (e.g. browsersync or transpile/compile/minify).

Then CI/CD is configured in VisualStudio Online [vsts] where the output files are created then deployed to a staging slot on [Azure] before a VIP switch to production/live.
